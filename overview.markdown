#### _Hey Developers at WIP Jam 2014, mashup Mashery APIs with Intel XDK!_

Navigate dozens of [Mashery powered APIs](http://developer.mashery.com), including [ESPN](http://developer.espn.com), [Crunchbase](http://developer.crunchbase.com), [Hotwire](http://developer.hotwire.com), [Edmunds.com](http://developer.edmunds.com), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com), with a single sign-in using the [Mashery API Explorer](http://developer.mashery.com/iodocs). 

Mashup the Mashery APIs with [Intel XDK](http://xdk-software.intel.com) to build Cross-Platform Mobile apps. Get started building an HTML5 mobile app quickly by downloading the Intel XDK and using embedded Mashery sample apps for RESTful APIs such as Hotwire, Rotten Tomatoes, World Weather Online, and many more. 

#### What is the Mashery API Network?

The Mashery API Network allows you to register once and gain access to 40+ Mashery-powered RESTful APIs with a single sign-on. With over 245,000 developers and 86,000 active applications, the Mashery API Network helps developers get started with APIs quickly and overcome common pain points during app development. 

Get to know the [best API evangelism team](http://masherydev.tumblr.com) in the business. Mashery's Developer Evangelists (meet [@mansillaDev](http://twitter.com/mansilladev) and [@amit](://twitter.com/amit)) would be on the ground at WIP Jam Hackathon to help you build some awesome apps. 

#### What is Intel XDK?

Intel XDK is a cross-platform mobile development toolkit that allosw you to build Android, iOS and Windows 8 apps using standard web frameworks. If you can write code in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript*, you can use the Intel XDK to build an HTML5 web app or a hybrid app for all of the major app stores.
